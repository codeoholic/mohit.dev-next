It has been a few years now that I am been working towards it. The people who have been around me for long enough have been asked this question over and have discussed about it at length.
Let's talk about it now.
1. **Work** - It should be your utmost priority in life. Making enough money in your life will make sure all other dominos of life stay as desired. ***No it doesn't mean, being enslaved by work because it is just one of the things we aim for*** 
2. **Workouts** - Once you have made enough money for the day, second order of priority is to make sure you workout and keep your body healthy. *No, walking for 30 minutes straight in the morning and post dinner doesn't count. [why?](https://mohit.dev/thought/why-walking-is-not-an-exercise)*
